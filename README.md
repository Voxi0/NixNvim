This is my Neovim configuration using [NVF](https://github.com/NotAShelf/nvf). Nix handles installing everything e.g. plugins while Lua is for configuring.
This repo is used in my [NixOS](https://nixos.org) configuration, [NixDots](https://github.com/Voxi0/NixDots).

Try it out ->
`nix run git+https://github.com/Voxi0/NixNvim`
